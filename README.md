#The project "Employees_APP" was developed.
#The project uses the classic approach of class react components. A method for adding new employees has been implemented, as well as a filter with a search criterion for employees. Each employee has the ability to set a bonus, change the salary (changes are pulled into the state) and put a mark on the increase.
